# Caste, Landownership, and Expenditure Gaps in Uttar Pradesh (ACCESS 2018)

This project analyzes caste-based economic differences using the ACCESS 2018 household survey, focusing on Uttar Pradesh. The goal is to examine how caste, gender, landownership, and education shape monthly household expenditure patterns. The analysis demonstrates core data cleaning and transformation techniques in R—including factor creation, filtering, grouping, summarization, and exploratory statistics—while providing a clear empirical look at socioeconomic inequality.

Key questions explored include:

- How do monthly expenditures differ between General and Reserved caste households?
- Are caste differences explained by landownership, gender, or educational attainment?
- What share of landowners come from each caste category?
- How do expenditure gaps change when we compare only landowning households?

All code is fully reproducible in the included  `.Rmd` file, with modular chunks for clarity.
